# Customer_segmentation_RFM_analysis_project
## Project Overview 
Welcome to our Customer Segmentation project focused on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis. This project emphasizes the importance of data-driven decision-making for refining business strategies.
Our main goal is to provide businesses with deeper insights into their customer base, allowing them to optimize marketing strategies and drive sustained growth. We believe that the insights gained from this analysis will be invaluable for informed strategic decision-making.

# `Ask`

### Business Problem Statement

In the rapidly evolving business environment, gaining a deep understanding of customer behavior is a key differentiator for success. Companies are constantly seeking answers to questions such as: Who are our highest value customers? How can we enhance customer loyalty? How can we optimize our marketing efforts for better returns?

This project is aimed to tackle these pressing business issues by implementing a Customer Segmentation model based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis. The objective is to classify customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing patterns, which can then guide targeted and effective marketing strategies.

By applying the RFM model, businesses can identify their most profitable customers, comprehend the buying behavior of different customer segments, and customize their marketing and sales strategies accordingly. This could lead to improved customer retention, enhanced customer lifetime value, and ultimately, increased profitability.

The challenge is in accurately analyzing and interpreting the data, and converting these insights into actionable business strategies. This is where our project steps in. Harnessing the capabilities of Microsoft SQL Server and Tableau, we aim to equip businesses with the necessary tools to make informed decisions and stay competitive in the market.

#### Guiding Questions for our analysis

- What is the total Revenue generated by the Products?
- what are the monthly sales by the country?
- which country is the highest contributer in revenue?
- which year bussiness was the strongest?
- Who are our highest value customers?
- How can we enhance customer loyalty?
- How can we optimize our marketing efforts for better returns?

# `Prepare`

**Introduction to the Prepare Phase of Data Analysis**

During the Prepare phase of our data analysis journey, we lay the groundwork for extracting actionable insights from our dataset. Our dataset was meticulously collected from [sales_data_sample](), encompassing [mention any relevant details about the dataset, such as time frame, geographic scope, or specific variables].

To proceed, we initiated a comprehensive data preparation process, beginning with data cleaning and preprocessing. This involved identifying and addressing any inconsistencies, missing values, or outliers that could potentially distort our analysis. By ensuring data integrity and reliability, we set a solid foundation for accurate and meaningful insights.

Next, we embarked on data transformation tasks to enhance the usability and interpretability of our dataset. This included feature engineering, where we derived new variables or modified existing ones to capture relevant patterns or relationships. Additionally, we standardized or normalized our data to facilitate comparisons and modeling.

Throughout the Prepare phase, we maintained a systematic approach, documenting our procedures and decisions to ensure reproducibility and transparency. By adhering to best practices in data preparation, we set the stage for robust analysis and informed decision-making in the subsequent phases of our project.

Join us as we delve deeper into the Prepare phase, where data transformation and refinement pave the way for actionable insights and impactful outcomes.
